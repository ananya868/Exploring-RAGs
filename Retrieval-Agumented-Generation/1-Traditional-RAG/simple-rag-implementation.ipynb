    "- Retrieval: When a user pass a query, semantic similarity matching techniques are used to fetch most relevant piece of information from the knowledge base that is stored.\n",
    "- Generation: The fetched context is passed on to a LLM, which is specifically prompted to only use the context to write answer.\n",
